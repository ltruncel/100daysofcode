# AI_100daysofcode

### Hi! LauraT here. Here's my coding/learning log in 2019, during which I focused on deep learning and AI.  I did a bit more than 100 days, for a total of 165. *smile*



6.2.19

#100-days-of-code D1

I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to participate in the Secure and Private AI Challenge Scholarship program from Facebook.  What better way to record my progress during the journey than starting my 100 days of code at the same time!  :)  Today I got all of the notebooks from the Udacity deep learning repo on github (https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), and begin building single layer networks with PyTorch.  Good stuff!  


6.3.19

D2 (wrote directly in Slack. See screen shot)


6.4.19

#100-days-of-code *D3*

Realizing I needed more knowledge about GPU, I took a detour to review how I can use cloud provider like AWS to spin up a GPU instance and train my own neural networks on the latest GPU hardware. I had gotten promotional credits through my full enrollment with the Udacity machine learning engineer Nanodegree, so I can use SageMaker to build, train and deploy machine learning models.  I found many helpful resources here: https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/aws-educate-and-udacity/


6.5.19

#100-days-of-code *D4*: A typical day of learning, grinding through the exercises in the repo and calculated the output of single layer neural networks using various approaches. :triplets-parrot: Hoping to get to multilayer networks tomorrow. 


6.6.19

#100-days-of-code *D5*: Busy day. I worked on exercises for multilayer networks. Reviewed different types of activation functions by reading this helpful piece: https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-and-its-types-which-is-better-a9a5310cc8f

6.7.19

#100-days-of-code *D6*: Feeling stuck with my dog breed project, I reviewed lectures about convolutional neural networks, including categorical cross-entropy loss.  Turns out it’s not as simple as I thought. https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/

6.8.19

#100-days-of-code *D7*: More convolution networks.  Began working on building a network that can predict digits in an image.  Created an account on Kaggle. :)

6.9.19
#100-days-of-code *D8*: It was difficult to concentrate on learning today. My best friend’s dog Butters passed away this morning.  I had just seen him two days ago. He was as gentle and quiet as he’s always been, and I would not have thought this day would come. :sob: I managed to bury myself in the resources channel of the AI scholarship program and read through a lot of materials.  I continued to work on the exercise of building neural networks in Pytorch to identify text in images.  

6.10.19
#100-days-of-code *D9*: Worked on the fashion-mnist exercise.  It was fun to read through a bunch of documentations along the way.  The official PyTorch cheat sheet is awesome :party_owl:: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html


6.11.19
#100-days-of-code *D10*: I was very happy to find a bunch of micro courses on Kaggle and I spent most of my time working thorough the courses.  https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview.  

6.12.19
[in Openmind]
I was a biz major and did a lot of math/calculus/statistics but nothing AI related.  I learned python, web development and machine learning through Udacity.  The secure and private AI scholarship is an eye-opener for me.  

#100-days-of-code *D11*: Continue the micro course on Kaggle.  Working on the Data Visualization unit. 


6.13.19

#100-days-of-code *D12*: I did some fun Python coding practices on Kaggle before I switched to the Inference and Validation unit for PyTorch.  Lots of crazy difficult concepts popping up here and there today, but my heart is bursting with joy.  I know I’m learning. A LOT. :)


6.14.19

#100-days-of-code *D13*: It was a beautiful day. :sun_with_face: I got to open the windows and let the breeze in when I went through lessons of deep neural networks - continuous perceptrons, feedforward, backpropagation, Keras and TensorFlow :tensorflow: (of course:grin:).  


6.15.19

#100-days-of-code *D14*: It was still a beautiful day.  I worked on a mini project in Keras and analyzed a dataset of student admissions.  the Inference and Validation unit for PyTorch. 


6.16.19

#100-days-of-code *D15*: Happy Father’s Day to all dads out there!  I’m grateful that my father has always encourages me not to be limited by gender roles.  He gave me my first robot to build and has always trusted me to fix the electronics and computers around the house. (They are not always fixed of course ).  Today I completed the students admissions project. 


6.17.19

I sustained a concussion and went to the ER yesterday.  The daily coding challenge was unfortunately interrupted as a result.  The doctor has advised that I stay away from mentally strenuous activities (computer & screen time count) for two days to avoid the symptoms getting worse.  I’ll plan to return to my coding challenge in two days and hopefully I’ll feel better by then.


6.21.19

#100-days-of-code *D16*: I’m simply overjoyed to get back to my coding routine after multiple ER visits this week.  I spent some time figuring out my study plans for next week (since I missed a few days of work this week). Worked on early stopping algorithm and dropout (https://github.com/vinsis/understanding-neuralnetworks-pytorch/wiki/Understanding-Dropout).  I also signed up for LeetCode. :)


6.22.19

#100-days-of-code *D17*: Learning to save and load models in PyTorch as well as a variety of data argumentation techniques (https://medium.com/ymedialabs-innovation/data-augmentation-techniques-in-cnn-using-tensorflow-371ae43d5be9)


6.23.19

#100-days-of-code *D18*: Worked on developing an algorithm for a dog identification app, a part of my machine learning engineer courses.  Read lots of Keras documentation :dancing-nerd-gal:


6.24.19

#100-days-of-code *D19*: More work on the dog identification app.  I’m still learning to determine when to use different core layers. Even more Keras documentation. 


6.25.19

#100-days-of-code *D20*: Continued to work on dog identification app.  I was really hoping I could complete the dog identification app but I had an issue with the keyboard of my MacBook Pro and I had to go to an Apple store for help. Turns out I’m one of those who’d be covered in the “quality program” because of a defect.  The thing is, I have to send it in for replacement and I’ll be out of my mac for a week!  

6.26.19

#100-days-of-code *D21*: Switched gear to work on PyTorch. Did the transfer learning exercise. Almost done with the unit. I sent in my laptop for repair and am working on an old mac. I was happy that given all the laptop trouble I was reasonably productive. :smiley:

6.27.19

#100-days-of-code *D22*: Completed transfer learning exercise the last unit of Deep Learning with PyTorch. 

6.28.19/6.29.19

3. Continued the style transfer course in Deep Learning with PyTorch, currently learning about Gram Matrix :matrix:


7.1.19

#100-days-of-code *D26*: Completed Lesson 4 Evaluating the Privacy of a Function. While working on the exercise of performing a differencing attack, I went through other materials about privacy engineering (like this one: https://www.privitar.com/resources). I’ll plan to organize my notes for Lesson 4.


7.2.19

#100-days-of-code *D27*: Went through Lesson 5 Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy, currently working on implementing local differential privacy. 


7.3.19

#100-days-of-code *D28*: Worked on the “Varying the Amount of Noise” project in Lesson 5 (Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy).  It’s a difficult one for me and I’m working through my notebook it slowly. Read a paper: “Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Client Level Perspective” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07557.pdf)


7.4.19

#100-days-of-code *D29*: I went through course video of the Formal Definition of Differential Privacy and looked into info about epsilon - delta (Like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70af5Ou70M) I’m totally enjoying the math part of the course.  I read “Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Client Level Perspective”.  Nice read and highly recommend it (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07557.pdf).
